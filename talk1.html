              <strong>Biography:</strong> I am currently a full
              professor at U. Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I
              recently moved from U.C Berkeley, where I was also
              full professor. I have published over 130 papers on
              computer vision, computer graphics and machine
              learning. I have served as program co- chair for IEEE
              Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition in 2000,
              general co-chair for CVPR 2006, and program co-chair
              for the European Conference on Computer Vision 2008,
              and am a regular member of the program committee of
              all major international conferences on computer
              vision. I have served four years on the SIGGRAPH
              program committee, and am a regular reviewer for that
              conference. I have received best paper awards at the
              International Conference on Computer Vision and at
              the European Conference on Computer Vision. I
              received an IEEE technical achievement award for 2005
              for my research and became an IEEE fellow in 2009. My
              recent textbook, "Computer Vision: A Modern Approach"
              (joint with J. Ponce and published by Prentice Hall)
              is now widely adopted as a course text (adoptions
              include MIT, U. Wisconsin-Madison, UIUC, Georgia Tech
              and U.C. Berkeley).</p>

            <td width="540" colspan="2">

              More Words and Bigger Pictures</p>

              <p align="justify" class="text">Object recognition is
              a little like translation: a picture (text in a
              source language) goes in, and a description (text in
              a target language) comes out. I will use this
              analogy, which has proven fertile, to describe recent
              progress in object recognition.<br />
              We have very good methods to spot some objects in
              images, but extending these methods to produce
              descriptions of images remains very difficult. The
              description might come in the form of a set of words,
              indicating objects, and boxes or regions spanned by
              the object. This representation is difficult to work
              with, because some objects seem to be much more
              important than others, and because objects interact.
              An alternative is a sentence or a paragraph
              describing the picture, and recent work indicates how
              one might generate rich structures like this.
              Furthermore, recent work suggests that it is easier
              and more effective to generate descriptions of images
              in terms of chunks of meaning ("person on a horse")
              rather than just objects ("person"; "horse").<br />
              Finally, if the picture contains objects that are
              unfamiliar, then we need to generate useful
              descriptions that will make it possible to interact
              with them, even though we don't know what they
              are.<br /></p>
