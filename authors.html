                  Submission</strong></p>

              <p align="justify" class="text">Double Blind reviewing
                requires that the paper reviewers should not know the
                names or affiliation of the paper authors. This is
                desirable to remove any possible or perceived bias
                toward a paper on non technical grounds. However, in
                practice this is difficult to achieve in full as
                descriptions of background material or experiments,
                which are essential to the technical content of the
                paper, often give a clear indication to knowledgeable
                reviewers of the likely source of the paper. RSS 2014
                will try to adopt a pragmatic approach to double blind
                reviewing in which authors are encouraged to hide
                identity without unduly affecting the quality or import
                of their submission.</p>

              <p align="justify" class="text">The following general

              <p align="justify" class="text">RSS encourages
                submissions from areas that have been under-represented
                in previous years. It is recognized that not every
                paper will necessarily contain new theoretical results
                or new algorithms. RSS strongly encourages the
                submission of work that provides new models and
                analyses that are rigorously validated via
                experimentation.</p>

              <p align="justify" class="text">Submissions will be
                refereed on the basis of technical quality, novelty,
                significance, and clarity. Each submission will be
                thoroughly reviewed by at least three program committee
                members. Authors will have an opportunity to concisely
                respond to the reviews. Submissions, reviews, and the
                replies of the authors will then be discussed at an
                in-person area chair committee meeting. Authors of
                accepted manuscripts will be asked to submit final
                revisions for presentation at the conference.</p>

              <p align="justify" class="text" style=
                 "margin-top:30px"><strong>Policy on Multiple
                  Submissions</strong></p>

              <p align="justify" class="text">RSS will not accept any
                paper which, at the time of submission, is under review
                for another conference or has already been published or
                accepted for publication in a journal or another
                conference. Authors are also expected not to submit
                their papers elsewhere during the RSS 2014 reviewing
                period. These restrictions apply only to journals and
                conferences, not to workshops and similar specialized
                presentations with a limited audience and without
                archival proceedings. It is the task of the authors to
                clearly spell out the differences of their submitted
                papers with previous publications, and authors are
                required to indicate if any material has appeared at a
                previous venue (archival or not).</p>
